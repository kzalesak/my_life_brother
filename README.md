# A message for Svalbard from my brother

I asked my brother, who is currently 11 years old, if he would like to archive anything in the Github archive for the next 1000 years.

This is the message that we came up with, with his own peculiar sense of humor, a bit absurd and ironic. The games that he mentions are quite popular games to play with other kids of his generation on computers.

He is very sweet.
